The single-molecule dataset (SMD) format has been jointly developed in the groups of Dan Herschlag 
([Stanford](http://cmgm.stanford.edu/herschlag/)) and Ruben Gonzalez
([Columbia](http://www.columbia.edu/cu/chemistry/groups/gonzalez/index.html)) to facilitate publication and exchange of data 
and analysis results obtained in single-molecule studies.
